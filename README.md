# TikTok-Project-Classifying-videos-using-Machine-Learning

Overview : The TikTok data team seeks to develop a machine learning model to assist in the classification of videos as either claims or opinions. Previous investigation into the available data revealed that video engagement levels were highly indicative of claim status. The team is confident that the resulting model will meet all performance requirements. 

Problem statement : TikTok videos receive a large number of user reports for many different reasons. Not all reported videos can undergo review by a human moderator. Videos that make claims (as opposed to opinions) are much more likely to contain content that violates the platform’s terms of service. TikTok seeks a way to identify videos that make claims to prioritize them for review.

Solution : We built two tree-based classification models. Both models were used to predict on a held-out validation dataset, and final model selection was determined by the model with the best recall score. The final model was then used to score a test dataset to estimate future performance.

Results and Conclusion : Both model architectures—random forest (RF) and XGBoost—performed exceptionally well. The RF model had a better recall score (0.995) and was selected as champion. Performance on the test holdout data yielded near perfect scores, with only five misclassified samples out of 3,817. The most predictive features all were related to engagement levels generated by the video. This is not unexpected, as analysis from prior EDA pointed to this conclusion. 

This model can be recommended as it performed exceptionally well on both the validation and test data. Also the F1 scores and precision scores were consistently high. The model sucessfully classified claims and opinions. The current version of the model doesn't require any new features. However, for future references and model enhancements it would be helpful to have the total number of user reports for all videos posted by the author. It is recommended to monitor the distributions of video engagement levels to ensure that the model remains robust to fluctuations in its most predictive features.
